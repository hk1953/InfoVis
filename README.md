Problem

Our project aims to help taxi drivers in New York City to easily find the “target spots” they want to pick up passengers.
 
Taxi drivers, especially in crowded city like New York, are facing intense competition every day. Every taxi drivers are hoping to minimize the empty-load time during their work hours and also, get more money earned. Fortunately, NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) provide records of all historical taxi data in past few years. With those data, taxi drivers no longer need to find passengers in blind. However, simply show those data to taxi drivers directly is not a wise way because those data is complex to analyze and it is difficult for drivers to find their interested information from those data directly.
 
Therefore, developing an effective visual analytic tool to interactively mine and visualize those data to those taxi drivers with their own needs will be helpful for them to work more efficiency. On the other hand, it can also optimize passengers’ satisfactory as well because no passenger prefer to wait a super long time until get a taxi.


Data
Our dataset are yellow cab records that provided by NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission. The first week of April 2016 data will be used in this project.  Besides, shape-files of Manhattan in building blocks scale and neighborhood scale will be used as well.


Questions

Where is the highest taxi demanding area in Manhattan in different time intervals?

Taxi demanding will change at different place at different time. For example in rush hour, it is possible that more potential passengers may take taxi from residence places to their working places. Counting the pickups in history of each building block with 1 hour as time interval can help to provide the answer. With this analysis and visualization, taxi drivers can easily find in specific time interval, where exactly is the best place near them to pick up passengers. 

Where and when to find the places those passengers prefer to pay highest tips.

Taxi drivers usually want to earn more for each trip. However, tips amount are not always affected by total amount. By calculating the average tip percentage of totally amount and mapping results to map can help drivers find out in which area and time, people prefer to pay higher tips.
 
Where and when is the place that passengers usually pay with cash rather than credit cards?

Sometimes, drivers prefer to get cash directly to avoid withdraw from ATM again. Sometimes, they just prefer to get money with credit cards for some safety reasons. By analyzing the credit card/cash ratio in spatial-temporal can help to find the place that fit for those drivers’ need.
